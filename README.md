# OMI Chan (Discord Bot)

OMI-Chan is a Discord bot created by Cause and meant to assist with the internal functionality of The OMI Group when convening on Discord.

### Operation Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Redis 4+
- Discord.py 1.7+

### Bot Installation
During its development the bot will remain in private invite mode as it is meant for only the one server, however it should be noted that I am writing it in a way which will allow it to eventually be invited to multiple servers to help spread the awesome awareness and functionality we plan to implement along the way!

### Initial Features in Development:
- Member Registration
- Restricted Access Management
- Meeting Attendance Tracker
- Community Polling & Voting
- Automated Channel Notifications
- Subscribe to Reminders
- Repetative Info Shortcut Tags

### Future Functionality:
- Github Discussions
- Principle Suggestions
- Swag / Badge System
- Reaction Based Role Assignments
- CAPTCHA Lobby

### More to Come...
Stay tuned!
